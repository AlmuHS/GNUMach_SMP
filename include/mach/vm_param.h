 *	The machine independent pages are referred to as PAGES.  A page
 *	is some number of hardware pages, depending on the target machine.
 *
 *	All references to the size of a page should be done
 *	with PAGE_SIZE, PAGE_SHIFT, or PAGE_MASK.
 *	They may be implemented as either constants or variables,
 *	depending on more-specific code.
 *	If they're variables, they had better be initialized
 *	by the time system-independent code starts getting called.
 *
 *	Regardless whether it is implemented with a constant or a variable,
 *	the PAGE_SIZE is assumed to be a power of two throughout the
 *	virtual memory system implementation.
 *
 *	More-specific code must at least provide PAGE_SHIFT;
 *	we can calculate the others if necessary.
 *	(However, if PAGE_SHIFT really refers to a variable,
 *	PAGE_SIZE and PAGE_MASK should also be variables
 *	so their values don't have to be constantly recomputed.)
