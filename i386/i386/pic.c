** 1. First we form a table of PIC masks - rather then calling form_pic_mask()
**	each time there is a change of interrupt level - we will form a table
**	of pic masks, as there are only 7 interrupt priority levels.
**
** 2. The next thing we must do is to determine which of the PIC interrupt
**	request lines have to be masked out, this is done by calling
**	form_pic_mask() with a (int_lev) of zero, this will find all the
**	interrupt lines that have priority 0, (ie to be ignored).
**	Then we split this up for the master/slave PICs.
**
** 2. Initialise the PICs , master first, then the slave.
**	All the register field definitions are described in pic_jh.h, also
**	the settings of these fields for the various registers are selected.
