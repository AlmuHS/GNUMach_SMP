 *	Routine:	vm_fault_page
 *	Purpose:
 *		Find the resident page for the virtual memory
 *		specified by the given virtual memory object
 *		and offset.
 *	Additional arguments:
 *		The required permissions for the page is given
 *		in "fault_type".  Desired permissions are included
 *		in "protection".
 *
 *		If the desired page is known to be resident (for
 *		example, because it was previously wired down), asserting
 *		the "unwiring" parameter will speed the search.
 *
 *		If the operation can be interrupted (by thread_abort
 *		or thread_terminate), then the "interruptible"
 *		parameter should be asserted.
 *
 *	Results:
 *		The page containing the proper data is returned
 *		in "result_page".
 *
 *	In/out conditions:
 *		The source object must be locked and referenced,
 *		and must donate one paging reference.  The reference
 *		is not affected.  The paging reference and lock are
 *		consumed.
 *
 *		If the call succeeds, the object in which "result_page"
 *		resides is left locked and holding a paging reference.
 *		If this is not the original object, a busy page in the
 *		original object is returned in "top_page", to prevent other
 *		callers from pursuing this same data, along with a paging
 *		reference for the original object.  The "top_page" should
 *		be destroyed when this guarantee is no longer required.
 *		The "result_page" is also left busy.  It is not removed
 *		from the pageout queues.

 *		the operation was interrupted (only possible if the
 *		"interruptible" argument is asserted).  Other return values
 *		indicate a permanent error in copying the data.
 *
 *		The actual amount of data copied will be returned in the
 *		"copy_size" argument.  In the event that the destination map
 *		verification failed, this amount may be less than the amount
 *		requested.
