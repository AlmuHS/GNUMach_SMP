/*
 *	Virtual memory objects maintain the actual data
 *	associated with allocated virtual memory.  A given
 *	page of memory exists within exactly one object.
 *
 *	An object is only deallocated when all "references"
 *	are given up.  Only one "reference" to a given
 *	region of an object should be writeable.
 *
 *	Associated with each object is a list of all resident
 *	memory pages belonging to that object; this list is
 *	maintained by the "vm_page" module, but locked by the object's
 *	lock.
 *
 *	Each object also records the memory object port
 *	that is used by the kernel to request and write
 *	back data (the memory object port, field "pager"),
 *	and the ports provided to the memory manager, the server that
 *	manages that data, to return data and control its
 *	use (the memory object control port, field "pager_request")
 *	and for naming (the memory object name port, field "pager_name").
 *
 *	Virtual memory objects are allocated to provide
 *	zero-filled memory (vm_allocate) or map a user-defined
 *	memory object into a virtual address space (vm_map).
 *
 *	Virtual memory objects that refer to a user-defined
 *	memory object are called "permanent", because all changes
 *	made in virtual memory are reflected back to the
 *	memory manager, which may then store it permanently.
 *	Other virtual memory objects are called "temporary",
 *	meaning that changes need be written back only when
 *	necessary to reclaim pages, and that storage associated
 *	with the object can be discarded once it is no longer
 *	mapped.
 *
 *	A permanent memory object may be mapped into more
 *	than one virtual address space.  Moreover, two threads
 *	may attempt to make the first mapping of a memory
 *	object concurrently.  Only one thread is allowed to
 *	complete this mapping; all others wait for the
 *	"pager_initialized" field is asserted, indicating
 *	that the first thread has initialized all of the
 *	necessary fields in the virtual memory object structure.
 *
 *	The kernel relies on a *default memory manager* to
 *	provide backing storage for the zero-filled virtual
 *	memory objects.  The memory object ports associated
 *	with these temporary virtual memory objects are only
 *	generated and passed to the default memory manager
 *	when it becomes necessary.  Virtual memory objects
 *	that depend on the default memory manager are called
 *	"internal".  The "pager_created" field is provided to
 *	indicate whether these ports have ever been allocated.
 *	
 *	The kernel may also create virtual memory objects to
 *	hold changed pages after a copy-on-write operation.
 *	In this case, the virtual memory object (and its
 *	backing storage -- its memory object) only contain
 *	those pages that have been changed.  The "shadow"
 *	field refers to the virtual memory object that contains
 *	the remainder of the contents.  The "shadow_offset"
 *	field indicates where in the "shadow" these contents begin.
 *	The "copy" field refers to a virtual memory object
 *	to which changed pages must be copied before changing
 *	this object, in order to implement another form
 *	of copy-on-write optimization.
 *
 *	The virtual memory object structure also records
 *	the attributes associated with its memory object.
 *	The "pager_ready", "can_persist" and "copy_strategy"
 *	fields represent those attributes.  The "cached_list"
 *	field is used in the implementation of the persistence
 *	attribute.

	 *
	 *	Repeated asymmetric copy operations may be done.

	 *	the last copy, its copy object can be reused.
	 *	Otherwise, a new copy object can be inserted
	 *	between the original object and its previous
	 *	copy object.  Since any copy object is read-only,
	 *	this cannot affect the contents of the previous copy
	 *	object.
	 *

/*
 *	The relationship between vm_object structures and
 *	the memory_object ports requires careful synchronization.
 *
 *	All associations are created by vm_object_enter.  All three
 *	port fields are filled in, as follows:
 *		pager:	the memory_object port itself, supplied by
 *			the user requesting a mapping (or the kernel,
 *			when initializing internal objects); the
 *			kernel simulates holding send rights by keeping
 *			a port reference;
 *		pager_request:
 *		pager_name:
 *			the memory object control and name ports,
 *			created by the kernel; the kernel holds
 *			receive (and ownership) rights to these
 *			ports, but no other references.
 *	All of the ports are referenced by their global names.
 *
 *	When initialization is complete, the "initialized" field
 *	is asserted.  Other mappings using a particular memory object,
 *	and any references to the vm_object gained through the
 *	port association must wait for this initialization to occur.
 *
 *	In order to allow the memory manager to set attributes before
 *	requests (notably virtual copy operations, but also data or
 *	unlock requests) are made, a "ready" attribute is made available.
 *	Only the memory manager may affect the value of this attribute.
 *	Its value does not affect critical kernel functions, such as
 *	internal object initialization or destruction.  [Furthermore,
 *	memory objects created by the kernel are assumed to be ready
 *	immediately; the default memory manager need not explicitly
 *	set the "ready" attribute.]
 *
 *	[Both the "initialized" and "ready" attribute wait conditions
 *	use the "pager" field as the wait event.]
 *
 *	The port associations can be broken down by any of the
 *	following routines:
 *		vm_object_terminate:
 *			No references to the vm_object remain, and
 *			the object cannot (or will not) be cached.
 *			This is the normal case, and is done even
 *			though one of the other cases has already been
 *			done.
 *		vm_object_destroy:
 *			The memory_object port has been destroyed,
 *			meaning that the kernel cannot flush dirty
 *			pages or request new data or unlock existing
 *			data.
 *		memory_object_destroy:
 *			The memory manager has requested that the
 *			kernel relinquish rights to the memory object
 *			port.  [The memory manager may not want to
 *			destroy the port, but may wish to refuse or
 *			tear down existing memory mappings.]
 *	Each routine that breaks an association must break all of
 *	them at once.  At some later time, that routine must clear
 *	the vm_object port fields and release the port rights.
 *	[Furthermore, each routine must cope with the simultaneous
 *	or previous operations of the others.]
 *
 *	In addition to the lock on the object, the vm_object_cache_lock
 *	governs the port associations.  References gained through the
 *	port association require use of the cache lock.
 *
 *	Because the port fields may be cleared spontaneously, they
 *	cannot be used to determine whether a memory object has
 *	ever been associated with a particular vm_object.  [This
 *	knowledge is important to the shadow object mechanism.]
 *	For this reason, an additional "created" attribute is
 *	provided.
 *
 *	During various paging operations, the port values found in the
 *	vm_object must be valid.  To prevent these port rights from being
 *	released, and to prevent the port associations from changing
 *	(other than being removed, i.e., made null), routines may use
 *	the vm_object_paging_begin/end routines [actually, macros].
 *	The implementation uses the "paging_in_progress" and "wanted" fields.
 *	[Operations that alter the validity of the port values include the
 *	termination routines and vm_object_collapse.]
